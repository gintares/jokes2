***************************  USAGE

depending on how url is formed, there maybe needed modification in */jokes_any/js/raw/fs.js

    //this.resp={};
    var currentURL = window.location.href; 
    var urlA = currentURL.split('/'); 
    urlA.pop(); //remove part correspondong to action
    this.base_url = urlA.join('/');
    //console.log('base_url=');  console.log(this.base_url);
    this.ajax_url = this.base_url +'/ajax_call.php'; //amend the ajax action

comment out the above and add the correct url:
this.ajax_url = CORRECT_SERVER_PATH_TO_FILE + '/ajax_call.php'; 


***************************  DURATION

to write back-end took 30min,

to write front-end-js : took half a day, since i have lost recently part of my code, most javascript, and have no prepared function to deal with the user input.  

to write front-end-css : a day, since I was developing back-end the last years, and have no any style tools or templates installed or prepared, like node, npm, gulp,...
